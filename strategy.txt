Fot the betting strategy, we know that betting over if our predicted value is over 2.5 and under if otherwise is not a godd strategy.
We should bet for a value if and only if information we have is more than what is implied by the odd itself. We can test if it is by
comparing the probability distributions implied by odd and out prediction. We do this by assuming our predicted number of goals implies
a normal probability distribution centered around the predicted value with the variance equal to either the sse of our model or the variance
we previously determined to be implied by the relationship between the z-values of odd probabilities for different handicaps. We believe
the former is more reasonable. We compare the distribution inferred by our prediction and implied by the odds by comparing the 
probabilities of over or under 2.5 goals. Additional advantage of this approach is that we can choose not to bet at all when we don't 
normalize the probabilites calculated from the odds. When we don't have enough extra information to beat the bookmaker we will see that
both over and under probability values (1/odd case) by the bookmaker will be higher than what we predict. We can only bet for one
option when the probability from bookmaker is less than what we calculate.
