# 256proj

Currently only Part1 of the project for IE256 course of Spring 2019 at Boğaziçi University. We are the team "Golden Ball", comprised of:

  *Selman Berk Özkurt
   
  *Kadir Ahmet Aksu
  
  *Serhat Yılmaz


**Methodology**:Written completely in R version 3.2.3 for "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu" (through Ubuntu 16.04 Bash). All the intermediate manipulations on data are done in seperate sessions, results of which are recorded in .rds files and with relevant lines copied into empy text files with .r extension. All the graphical outputs are made directly to .pdf files for preservation of universality.
